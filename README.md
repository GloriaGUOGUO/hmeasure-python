Measuring Classification Performance: the hmeasure package for Python.

The H-measure package implements a large number of classification performance metrics, such as the AUC, Error Rate, sensitivity and specificity, and additionally extends standard libraries by incorporating recent advances in this area, notably including the H-measure which was proposed by David Hand as coherent alternative to the AUC.
